## Description 
This project is a daily planner that can be pulled up daily and tasks can be entered into time slots for a standard work day (9-5). This can better help with productivity and visually display a task list for the current day.

The reason I created this project was to better learn to use JQuery and local storage.

## Usage

 It utilizes a user's local storage to maintain the task list. Click on a time slot and enter whatever text input you'd like to add. Click the save button on the side and the application will save the input for that time slot into Local storage. As long as the browser isn't closed out entirely, the application tab can be closed and the tasks will remain. There is also the risk of losing the tasks if the local storage is cleared by another application in the same browser.
